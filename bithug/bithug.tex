\begin{abstract}
  This paper describes some of the design decisions taken in creating
  the \emph{Bithug Coding Social} web service. Bithug is a free, highly 
  configurable and social code hosting service created during the ``Social 
  Web Applications Engineering'' seminar at HPI in 2009/10. Its purpose is to 
  provide a free and more versatile alternative to the git hosting 
  site \emph{Github} for universities and companies internal code hosting needs.

\section{Introduction}
The increased interactivity of the Web 2.0 has in recent years brought about a 
shift in web technologies. One aspect of this shift is the increasing generation
of content by the consumer, clearly recognizable in the popularity of social 
networks.

In 2007, the classic generators of content on the web, the programmers, got 
their own social network where they could show off their interests and skills: 
the social coding site \emph{Github}\cite{github:www}. On Github, a user can 
create code repositories and freely share code with everyone else on the network.
Other users or projects can be ``followed'' which means, that every action on 
and by the followed user is reported in a feed (on page and via RSS). Commits
can be commented on, people can collaborate on projects and code is online and 
browsable.
All repositories on Github are initially open, however, for a monthly fee you 
can buy private space on Github where only people who have been explicitly 
granted access can view code.
\subsection{Why Social?}
In the past, the sufficiency of self-organizing social networks even on large 
scale projects has been demonstrated by open-source like the Linux 
Kernel\cite{kernel:www}, X.org\cite{xorg:www} or the GNU Project\cite{gnu:www}.
In their footsteps, emerging social websites time\cite{facebook:help} and 
time\cite{facebook:organize} again\cite{twitter:organize} have proven how losely
tied bodies are capable of organizing large events.

In this manner, we want Bithug not only to be a service to host code, but a 
network for exchanging ideas and organizing projects in a smaller university 
or corporate environment to form a ``community'' much like the open-source 
community which has formed on Github.
\subsection{The Lazy Web Concept}
Another change in how the web is used has come about through pages like 
FriendFeed, Twitter and most recently Facebook Lite. They provide short 
messaging services to post notes. \emph{Friends} or \emph{Followers} can
receive and read those messages \ldots or not. \\
This is the concept we the ``Lazy Web'', where content is not generated 
necessarily to be read, but to be there, if anybody is interested. Combined 
with social networks, important or interesting information will find its way 
around as others will carry on the message.

We want Bithug to integrate with services like Twitter to enable our users to
generate content about their activity and projects and possibly discuss them on
other services as well. Also, this way we provide integration with the 
information flow some consumers of the web have come to enjoy.
\section{Project Management as a Service}
Bithug, as an alternative code hosting service, intends to focus on the people 
behind the code. That means, common hosting features such as forking and creating 
repositories are made possible, but the most rewarding features lie in notifying 
the people involved in a project and giving them a platform to communicate on. As 
people and projects are be highly diverse, we intend to offer and integrate a 
number of webservices, authentication methods and repository settings. Because 
we intend enabling Bithug to be used in an academic context and smaller companies, 
configuration needs to be easily personalized and highly versatile.

\section{Technical Stuff}

\subsection{The Stack}
Our project split into three major subprojects: Bithug (out actual project), BigBand (parts of Bithug you can use in any Sinatra Project), MonkeyLib (parts you can use in any Ruby project).

Patched versions of krb5-auth (currently unmaintained) and Ohm.

Other libraries we use: ...

Stack is known to work on ...

\subsection{Sinatra}
Sinatra is a ruby web framework\cite{sinatra:www}, lately becoming a popular alternative to Ruby On Rails and Merb.
In contrast to those is has a small code base, does not ship with and persistence layer and does not focus on code
generation. In many cases this will result in better performance than a Rails application, especially for single
purpose applications, since the code size of Rails alone causes such a long dispatch that Sinatra performs much better.

Having a small and clean code base can also be useful, as it is easy for a developer to understand what is going on under the hood.
Also, for some not offering a out of the box ORM solution is a feature, rather than a short-coming, as it is easier to
choose another solution if the system does not assume it is coping with its own ORM (ActiveRecord, in that case). However,
it should be mentioned that those disadvantages have been reduced or removed in the upcoming Rails milestone 3.0.

\subsection{Using dynamic inheritance as means of configuration}
In class-based object-oriented programming inheritance is often used as specialization.
For instance, in an application managing costumers, the class Costumer might have the same
superclass as the class Administrator, as they might share some common logic and attributes.

This behavior can be used for application configuration, where one configuration option can be seen
as a special class inheriting from a more general Application class. In our application we use this
approach for our two core classes: User and Repository.

For instance: You want to use Kerberos authentication. With the previous explanation it could be possible
to have a Kerberos::User class, inheriting from Bithug::User, overwriting the authentication method.
This is actually very close to what we do internally. As you might suspect this approach fails when offering
combinable options. What if you to offer Kerberos and LDAP authentication both as stand-alone solution or
on as a fallback for the other (which is a typical network setup, in our experience). In a language that offers
multiple inheritance, you could create the classes Kerberos::User and Ldap::User, that both inherit from Bithug::User
and than create the classes KerberosWithLdapFallback::User and LdapWithKerberosFallback::User both inheriting
from Kerberos::User and Ldap::User. Would this language not be able to define classes at runtime, it would even be
more complicated, as you would have to generate all possible combinations at compile time. Ruby however does offer
runtime creation of classes. But it does lack multiple inheritance.

A third approach would be to change a classes inheritance chain by altering its superclass at runtime (or at compile
time, for that matter, which would be less dynamic). Upfront: Even though this is possible in most Ruby implementations,
it is considered extremely dangerous\footnote{Apart from maybe even seriously breaking your object space, you would have
to clear a couple of caches used by the underlying Ruby implementation to speed up method dispatch.}, and is not used
by Bithug. It should still be explained, as it helps to understand our implementation for not familiar with the Ruby
method dispatch. Let us take the above example: To configure a system that would first try to authenticate against Kereberos
and if that fails try LDAP authentication, you could change the superclass of Kerberos::User to Ldap::User which still
is a subclass of Bithug::User. If you implement a method Bithug::User.authenticate(login, password), that should return
true if authentication succeeds and false otherwise. Now, if Bithug::User.authenticate always returns false and both
Kerberos::User.authenticate and Ldap::User.authenticate return true if the authentication against LDAP/Kerberos succeeds,
the result of their superclass's authenticate the setup would be complete. This approach is somewhat comparable to context-
or aspect-oriented programming, where you are able to wrap aspects around an object\cite{apel2006aspectual}.

Ruby supports a concept called Mixins\cite{apel2004using}. Mixins are one use case for Ruby modules\footnote{Others are namespacing
and classes without instances.}. A Ruby module is defined like a Ruby class. You can define both instance and singleton
methods\footnote{Methods defined on class side, also known as class methods.}. However, as you cannot instantiate a module,
its instance methods are not directly usable. You can include such a module in a class. It is a common misbelieve – even among
long time rubyists – that by doing so the unbound methods\footnote{Ruby term for not yet belonging to an object, thus not being
callable.} are copied to the class and by doing so overwriting existing methods. In reality when including a module in a class,
a new class is created, containing all the modules instance methods. That class is inserted in the inheritance chain in-between
the original class and its superclass (or previously included modules). This allows a similar usage as changing the superclass
without its complications.

However, if you followed the above explanation closely, you might already see two major issues with that approach. As mentioned,
only the instance methods become part of the new class. The singleton methods are already bound to the module and cannot be
rebound to the class. The solution is a common pattern one will often fine in ruby programs: Use another mixin for the class methods
and include that mixin in the singleton class\footnote{A class every object in ruby has. It keeps all the singleton methods of an
object as instance methods and has that object as sole instance – hence singleton class.}.

The other problem is, that a module is inserted after the class in the inheritance chain, not in front of it. In the Kerberos/LDAP
example, Bithug::User.authenticate would always return false, since the Kerberos and LDAP implementations never get called. Our
solution to that is to have an empty class (i.e. without method definitions) called Bithug::User subclassing Bithug::AbstractUser.
All our common logic is placed inside AbstractUser. Now, if we include a module in Bithug::User, it is inserted in front of AbstractUser
in the inheritance chain, thus getting called.
